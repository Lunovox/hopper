"Hopper blocks come in both 'vertical' and 'side' forms, but when in a "
"player's inventory both are represented by a single generic item. The type "
"of hopper block that will be placed when the player uses this item depends "
"on what is pointed at - when the hopper item is pointed at the top or bottom "
"face of a block a vertical hopper is placed, when aimed at the side of a "
"block a side hopper is produced that connects to the clicked-on side.\n"

"Hoppers have the same permissions as the player that placed them. Hoppers "
"placed by you are allowed to take items from or put items into locked chests "
"that you own, but hoppers placed by other players will be unable to do so. A "
"hopper's own inventory is not not owner-locked, though, so you can use this "
"as a way to allow other players to deposit items into your locked chests."
